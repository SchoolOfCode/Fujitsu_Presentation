I want to make component that will be a section of the webpage dedicated to a meditating activity
I want to have a button that will generate a random meditation activity
The generated content should have an audio file that the user can listen to, pause and play
The audio file will have a scrubber that the user can use to move to different parts of the audio file
There should also be a button that plays relaxing music when pressed, which is then paused when the button is pressed again
