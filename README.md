🛥 𝘽𝙤𝙖𝙩 𝙏𝙧𝙞𝙥 🛥
-- an energiser app built to combat mental and creativity burnout in coding bootcamps. With the increasing pressure and intensity in learning how to code just in 16 weeks, it's easy to feel like you're all at sea, struggling to stay afloat. But now, please come onboard, take a moment to relax, ride the waves, and recharge.

This MVP features two unique rooms that offer stress-reducing activities that also aim to boost your creativity.

🌊 🌊 🌊 🌊

✨Artist Studio: 
Users are given a set of creative challenges to train their brain muscles and come up with innovative ideas. For example, create an app idea for those in *Pulp Fiction* to use in a *cat restaurant* with *a sense of humour*. Feel free to get a little crazy and build that connection that you would never thought of before.

✨Music Massage: 
Our AI-generated guided meditation with soothing music is specifically tailored for bootcampers, offering a much-needed break from a day of hard-work. So forget about coding for just a few minutes and "we are swapping the bootcamp for breathing, and swapping react for relaxing..." Give it a go and share your feedback with us!

Let's ride the waves of inspiration, explore uncharted territories and emerge with newfound clarity and energy!!!
